"We must be pure. I do not speak merely of the purity of the senses. We must observe great purity in our will, in our intentions, in all our actions. 
--St. Peter Julian Eymard";
"God desires from you the least degree of purity of conscience more than all the works you can perform. 
--St. John of the Cross";
